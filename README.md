# **Mapping Earthquakes (Module 13)** 

This project aims to create a website with earthquake and tectonic plates activity data using Javascript and, in particular, the Leaflet library.

## **Abstract**

The data was extracted through API from GEOJSON and the official USGA website https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson. The final results are interactive maps, including the Earthquakes, Major Earthquakes and Tectonic plates activity data. The view can be filtered based on Satellite, Street or Dark mode.

The images of each view have been included below:
